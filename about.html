                    She believes great design is rooted in care and attention to detailâ€”just like momâ€™s food.
                </p>

                <h5>How and Why design?</h5>
                <p>In 2014, intrigued by a $300 AdSense revenue post on Facebook, she dove deep into blogging. She <span class="highlighter"> taught herself WordPress, PHP, HTML, and CSS</span> to launch her own blogging websiteâ€”all during a time when online resources were scarce.</p>
                <img src="img/adsense.jpg" alt="adsense">
                <figcaption>She was overjoyed when she got adsense approval</figcaption>
                <p> <span class="highlighter"> Dissatisfied</span> with WordPress's free themes, she began experimenting with custom designs in Photoshop. This experimentation sparked her passion for design. She started reading more about designs,  <span class="highlighter"> on her own.</span></p>
                <h5>Cybria Tech</h5>
                <p>Her professional journey began at Cybria Tech, a startup founded by her collage senior. It delivered software services to businesses. As their <span class="highlighter">solo designer </span> and <span class="highlighter">front-end</span> developer, she crafted and deployed both code and designs for numerous websites.</p>
                <h5>Muvi - A platform to lunch site like Netflix.</h5>
                <p>After a year and a half, she joined Exelanz and worked on their product Muvi, which tackled streaming platform challenges in 2015 and is now a market leader. As a movie enthusiast, she found the perfect fit. There, she created a product <span class="highlighter">style guide</span> and delivered custom designs for enterprise clients like <span class="highlighter">Sony</span> and Universal Motion Pictures. </p>
                <p>She also actively participated in <b>Google Developer Group Fest events</b> in Bhubaneswar, expanding her knowledge of Design Thinking, Material Design, and Polymer JS.</p>
                <h5>FusionCharts - Makes data delight.</h5>
                <p>Juggling both design and coding was challenging. Hence to focus solely on design, she relocated to Bangalore, India in 2017 and joined the talented team at FusionChartsâ€”a JS library used by <span class="highlighter">28,000 companies and 800,000+ developers </span>. Working with an exceptional team, they enhanced conversion rates, designed a new <a href="https://medium.com/swlh/how-to-approach-design-systems-in-startups-56ab6ce1b98a" target="_blank"><span class="highlighter">Design system</span></a> (Published by The Start Up), and improved various touchpoints through website revamp before the company's acquisition.</p>

                <h5>Fyle - Makes expense reporting breeze.</h5>
                <p>Just before COVID, she joined Fyle, an expense management platform for businesses. She helped shape the product from scratch to achieve product-market fit and led major initiatives after the company's pivot to the US market. She built Fyle's first design organization, and maintained <span class="highlighter">zero attrition for 2.5 years</span>. During her time, thebusiness grew from <span class="highlighter"> 0 to $5M+ and beyond</span>.</p>

                <p>During her time at Fyle, she <span class="highlighter">mentored interns</span> who grew into product designer I to II to senior designers and <span class="highlighter">helped other designers</span> and freshers who reached out through LinkedIn/Email/Behance.</p>
                <img src="img/community.jpeg" alt="">
                <h5>Break and Side Hustle</h5>
                <p>Currently, she's on an open-ended sabbatical to focus on personal growth after such an insane run. Also on side, she is solving <span class="highlighter">auto mobile space problems</span> on a theme of right to repair. </p>

                <h5>On portfolio</h5>
                <p>For this portfolio, She <span class="highlighter">experimented</span> with Framer and Webflow but ultimately decided to <span class="highlighter">code everything from scratch using Co-pilot</span>. She loved putting it all together again after so many years. </p>
