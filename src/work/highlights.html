                        <p>The platform enables accountants to export expenses from Fyle to QBO. The team initially built an MVP version, but as the business grew, experience-related problems emerged, leading to issues with efficiency, dependency on the customer success team, and scalability. <a href="https://stories.fylehq.com/p/how-did-we-revamp-fyle-accounting" target="_blank">View case study</a></p>

                        <h4>Fyle Copilot AI</h4>
                        <p>The initiative started as an MVP to explore AI capabilities in the expense management space.
                            While the larger goal was to enable users to "Ask anything," we began with a smaller scope, such as instantly searching through KB articles instead of browsing 100+ articles and providing analytics capabilities based on user queries.</p>
                        <p><b>Impacts</b></p>
                        <p>It is still in the early stages. After 30 days of GA, these were the stats—a solid starting point. The initial feedback has given us plenty of opportunities for improvement.
                        </p>
                        <p>This feature is currently unique in expense management market.</p>
