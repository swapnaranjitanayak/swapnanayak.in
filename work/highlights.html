                        When I joined Fyle as a senior designer, we were focused on the Indian market, but COVID hit
                        hard and it impacted business, forcing a <a

                            SMB space</b>.
                        This shift <span class="highlighter">changed </span> our customer base, market dynamics, and product
                            priorities.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        While the product and sales teams conducted customer interviews and demos to validate our
                        offerings, <b>designers extracted key usability and behavioral insights from call recordings</b>
                        to shape the product experience for this new market.
                    </p>

                    <p>At the same time, I was stepping into <a

                    <h4>â†³ Boosting Camera Capture Feature Adoption (40% â†’ 72.7%) & revamping the mobile app</h4>
                    <h5>Why?</h5>
                    <p>To build trust in the U.S. market, our mobile app needed a strong first impression. (front door
                        effect)
                        A key feature, 'InstaFyle' <span class="highlighter">(an AI-powered expense capture
                            tool)</span>,
                        suffered from low adoption due to unclear UX copy, prioritization and user experience.
                        Only <b>40% of users</b> adopted it, while <b>51% preferred</b> manual expense entry, which took
                        over 42 seconds per expense.</p>

                    <h5>What we did?</h5>
                    <p>We did heuristic evaluation, analysed tickets and customer insights to revamp the user experience of the entire app
                        for improving scalability, navigation, UX copy, and
                        feedback loops in different flows. For this specific one, We removed 'InstaFyle' UX copy and used a more highlighted camera icon, making
                        it
                        the most intuitive way to log expenses.</p>

                    <h4>â†³ Cutting Accounting Integration Setup Time (5-7 Days â†’ 15 Minutes)</h4>
                    <h5>Why</h5>
                    <p>Fyleâ€™s accounting integration was a critical bridge between our platform and accounting software
                        like QBO and QBD,
                        enabling seamless data transfer.

                    <p> However, the initial engineer-built MVP faced significant challenges.
                        The user interface was complex, error messaging was unclear, and the setup process was
                        cumbersome,
                        resulting in a <b>5-7 day integration time</b> and <b>heavy reliance</b> on our customer success
                        team.
                        This hindered scalability and created a frustrating user experience. Â 
                    </p>
                    <h5>What we did</h5>
                    <p>To address these issues, we redesigned the integration with a focus on user self-service and
                        simplicity. We implemented a design system for consistency, streamlined the workflow with
                        intuitive navigation, and added proactive error prevention.</p>

                    </h4>
                    <h5>Why?</h5>
                    <p>Competitors issued new corporate cards, but Fyle avoided potential business risks and decided to
                        leverage existing card infrastructure.
                        However, this created a significant disadvantage: card transactions entering Fyle could take 1
                        to 30 days for reconciliation,
                        depending on the mode of txn upload.
                    </p>
                    <h5>What we did</h5>
                    <p>We partnered with Visa & Mastercard to enable users to sync their existing cards, capturing
                        receipts via SMS when txn occurs. Our <b>UX simplified the card-linking process</b>, led to
                        one-shot approval from Visa/Mastercard.</p>

                        <p>
                            To send receipts via SMS, spenders needed to connect their cards.

                            to complete this step.
                            Many opted for alternative, more time-consuming expense creation methods instead.

                        <h4> â†³ Simplifying expense eeport closure</h4>
                        <h5>Why?</h5>
                        <p>
                            Finance teams handle diverse expense types, from corporate card payments to personal
                            reimbursements.
                            However, the existing workflow lacked flexibility, forcing finance personnel into
                            <b>unnecessary steps in every task flow</b> and creating confusion.
                        </p>
                        <p><b>Key issues included:</b></p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Rigid workflows: A single process for all expense types, despite varying finance team
                                needs.
                            </li>
                            <li>Misleading UI elements: Optional steps appearing mandatory, leading to inefficiencies.
                            </li>
                            <li> Lack of visibility: Failed reimbursements, pending settlements, and unclear payment
                                modes added to the <b>cognitive load</b>.</li>
                        </ul>

                        <h5>How we did it?</h5>
                        <p>
                            Since the flow involved different solutions tailored to various types of organizations, we
                            <span class="highlighter">journey-mapped</span> the existing flow and carefully analyzed the
                            necessary changes. Given the critical nature of this process, we ensured no edge cases were
                            overlooked, as missing any could have resulted in a major failure of the initiative.
                        </p>
                        <p>Once we finalized the solution, we implemented <span class="highlighter">a phased
                                release</span> to mitigate potential disruptions or user experience issues. We conducted
                            multiple rounds of <b>usability testing with customers</b>, followed by a limited rollout to
                            a small group before gradually expanding to a full general availability (GA) release.

                        <h5>Why</h5>
                        <p>
                            As finance teams manage growing volumes of expenses, they often struggle with tracking
                            spending patterns and finding relevant information quickly. To address this, we introduced
                            Fyle Co-Pilot AI, enabling users to get spend overview insights and effortlessly search
                            through knowledge base (KB) articles.
                        </p>
                        <h5>What we did</h5>
                        <ul>

                            <li>
                                Performed a competitive analysis within a short time frame to understand industry
                                standards and opportunities.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                Designed and launched the beta version quickly, allowing us to gather early feedback and
                                iterate.
                            </li>
                        </ul>
                        <h5>Early traction</h5>
