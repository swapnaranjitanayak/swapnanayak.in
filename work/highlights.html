                    <p>
                        When I joined Fyle as a senior designer, we were focused on the Indian market, but COVID hit
                        hard and it impacted business, forcing a <a

                            SMB space</b>.
                        This shift changed our <span class="highlighter">customer base, market dynamics, and product
                            priorities.</span>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        While the product and sales teams conducted customer interviews and demos to validate our
                        offerings, <b>designers extracted key usability and behavioral insights from call recordings</b>
                        to shape the product experience for this new market.
                    </p>

                    <p>At the same time, I was stepping into <a

                        navigating new responsibilities, driving critical decisions, ensuring faster execution,
                        and sometimes even getting my hands dirty to push things forward.

                    <p>
                        In this phase,our <span class="highlighter">strategy</span> was to focus more on <b>improving

                    <h5>Why?</h5>
                    <p>To build trust in the U.S. market, our mobile app needed a strong first impression. (front door
                        effect :))
                        A key feature, 'InstaFyle' <span class="highlighter">(an AI-powered expense capture
                            tool)</span>,
                        suffered from low adoption due to unclear UX copy, prioritization and user experience.
                        Only <b>40% of users</b> adopted it, while <b>51% preferred</b> manual expense entry, which took
                        over 42 seconds per expense.</p>

                    <h5>What we did?</h5>
                    <p>We did heuristic evaluation, analysed tickets and customer insights to revamp the user experience
                        for improving scalability, navigation, UX copy, and
                        feedback loops. We removed 'InstaFyle' UX copy and used a more highlighted camera icon, making
                        it
                        the most intuitive way to log expenses.</p>

                    <h4>↳ Cutting Accounting Integration Setup Time (5-7 Days → 15 Minutes)</h4>
                    <h5>Why</h5>
                    <p>Fyle’s accounting integration was a critical bridge between our platform and accounting software
                        like QBO and QBD,
                        enabling seamless data transfer.

                    <p> However, the initial engineer-built MVP faced significant challenges.
                        The user interface was complex, error messaging was unclear, and the setup process was
                        cumbersome,
                        resulting in a <b>5-7 day integration time</b> and <b>heavy reliance</b> on our customer success
                        team.
                        This hindered scalability and created a frustrating user experience.  
                    </p>
                    <h5>What we did</h5>
                    <p>To address these issues, we redesigned the integration with a focus on user self-service and
                        simplicity. We implemented a design system for consistency, streamlined the workflow with
                        intuitive navigation, and added proactive error prevention.</p>

                    </h4>
                    <h5>Why?</h5>
                    <p>Competitors issued new corporate cards, but Fyle avoided potential business risks and decided to
                        leverage existing card infrastructure.
                        However, this created a significant disadvantage: card transactions entering Fyle could take 1
                        to 30 days for reconciliation,
                        depending on the mode of txn upload.
                    </p>
                    <h5>What we did</h5>
                    <p>We partnered with Visa & Mastercard to enable users to sync their existing cards, capturing
                        receipts via SMS when txn occurs. Our <b>UX simplified the card-linking process</b>, led to
                        one-shot approval from Visa/Mastercard.</p>
                    <h5>✅ Result</h5>

                        <li>Pivoting to the U.S. market required rebuilding core workflows to fit a new audience.</li>
                        <li>User insights from call recordings helped refine feature adoption & usability.</li>

                    <p>With strong early traction, we moved toward Product-Market Fit (PMF)—focusing on revenue growth,

                        <h5>Why?</h5>

                        <p>
                            To send receipts via SMS, spenders needed to connect their cards.
                            However, despite visible prompts on the dashboard, users took <b>~288 hours</b> on average
                            to complete this step.
                            Many opted for alternative, more time-consuming expense creation methods instead.
                        </p>

                            a small group before gradually expanding to a full general availability (GA) release.

                        <h4>Fyle Copilot AI</h4>
                        <h5>Why</h5>
                        <p>
                            As finance teams manage growing volumes of expenses, they often struggle with tracking
                            spending patterns and finding relevant information quickly. To address this, we introduced
                            Fyle Co-Pilot AI, enabling users to get spend overview insights and effortlessly search
                            through knowledge base (KB) articles.
                        </p>
                        <h5>What we did</h5>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Conducted an intensive study on AI-driven design principles to ensure an intuitive user
                                experience.</li>
                            <li>
                                Performed a competitive analysis within a short time frame to understand industry
                                standards and opportunities.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                Designed and launched the beta version quickly, allowing us to gather early feedback and
                                iterate.
                            </li>
                        </ul>
                        <h5>Early traction</h5>
                        <p>49 admins asked 136 queries, indicating an early need for quick access to insights.</p>
                        <p>Adoption rate is yet to scale as the feature is in beta, and we are actively refining it
                            based on user feedback.</p>

                        <h4>.. And there are lot many 🎬</h4>
                        <p>
                            —some filled with wins, some with lessons—but let’s save those
                            for a chat over coffee. ☕
                            Until then, we’ll keep building, refining, and making an impact. 🚀
