                    <p>
                        When I joined Fyle as a <span class="highlighter">senior designer</span>, we were focused on the
                        Indian market, but during COVID, Fyle's business was severely impacted. This forced a <a
                            href="https://x.com/K2_181/status/1755622933387788367" target="_blank">strategic pivot</a>
                        to the U.S. market, changing the customer base entirely.
                    </p>
                    <p>Operating in a new market, managing number of custimer interviews and demo requests was exciting but overwhelming at a
                        business level.
                        At a team level, it was even more intense—I was stepping into <a
                            href="https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1Fb1rzNzFknVz2wCOI5mxZwgJOpRZNjhZGTWVR0QwZW4/edit#slide=id.ge10f0b3b65_1_12"
                            target="_blank">management for the first time</a>,
                        navigating new responsibilities while driving critical decisions, faster execution and sometimes
                        making my hands dirty too.
                    </p>

                    <h4> Strategic decisions: </h4>
                    <p>
                        We focused more on <span class="highlighter">improving the core workflow</span> as part of the
                        <span class="highlighter">strategy</span> to cater to US Customers' specific needs.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Core workflow refers to the entire process—from submitting expenses by the spender to closing
                        them by the admin and updating the accountant book like QBO, QBD etc.
                    </p>

                    <p>Followings are some of the <span class="highlighter"> key initiatives that I led</span> as per
                        our strategic themes. I was fortunate enough to work with a team of talented designers.</p>

                    <h4>↳ Increasing Camera Capture feature from 40.2% to 72.7% (~81% increase in usage)</h4>

                    <p> We undertook the <a href="https://stories.fylehq.com/p/why-and-how-did-we-redesign-our-mobile"
                            target="_blank"><b>mobile app revamp</b></a> to create a strong first impression (front door
                        effect)
                        and address issues like consistency, scalability, navigation, confusing UX copy, and feedback.
                        These improvements helped us deliver <b>great partnership demos in the global market.</b></p>

                    <p>Out of many, We focused on increasing Camera capture feature usage as it helps user capturing
                        expense information in the most intuitve way with <span class="highlighter">AI capabilities
                            within seconds</span>. Initially, this feature was called "InstaFyle," but customers found
                        it unclear. Only <b>40% of users</b> adopted it, while <b>51% still preferred manual expense
                            entry</b>, which often took over <b>42 seconds</b> per expense.

                    <h4>↳ Reducing Accounting Integration Set up timing from 5-7 days to 15 min</h4>
                    <p>The accounting integration platform serves as a bridge between Fyle and a business's accounting
                        books, enabling the seamless import and export of expense-related information.</p>

                    <p> Fyle's initial accounting integration was an MVP built by engineers. However, as the business
                        grew, experience-related challenges emerged, leading to inefficiencies, increased dependency on
                        the customer success team, and scalability issues.

                            case study</a>
                    </p>
                    <p>Hence we relooked at all touchpoints to simplify it. The new experience <span
                            class="highlighter">attracted many accounting firms to partner with Fyle</span> later. These
                        accounting partners, in turn, brought in numerous customers, helping Fyle <b>surpass $1M in
                            revenue.</b></p>
                    <h5>Key Outcomes</h5>
                    <ul>
                        <li>The adaptation rate for the new design reached <b>95%</b> within a quarter.</li>
                        <li>The time taken for setting up integration was reduced from 5 -7 days to 15min.</li>

                    <h4>↳ Helping customers integrate their own existing card & getting featured in Forbes</h4>
                    <p> Businesses provide corporate cards to employees for managing expenses, but Fyle’s existing
                        infrastructure required <span class="highlighter">a wait time of 1 to 30 days</span> for
                        transactions to reflect in the system, delaying reconciliation for the entire organization.
                    </p>
                    <p>Instead of issuing new cards like others, Fyle leveraged the existing card ecosystem. Our
                        partnership with Visa and Mastercard enabled users to integrate their own cards, instantly
                        capturing receipts via SMS the moment a transaction occurred, thus reduing the <b>TTV to
                            seconds</b>.
                        This led to <span class="highlighter"><b>85% of user adoptions</b></span> who sent receipts via
                        SMS.
                    </p>
                    <p>The design particulary helped users
                        integrating cards in a more efficient way on top of an existing eco system of adding cards via
                        Yodlee. Visa/Mastercard team approved the design in <b>one shot.</b></p>
