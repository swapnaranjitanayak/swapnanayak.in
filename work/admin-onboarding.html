                            class="highlighter">supporting a new revenue stream</span>.
                    </p>
            </div>
            <div class="blog-content">
                <h3>Why Onboarding?</h3>
                <p> Before we begin, let's understand what Fyle does...</p>
                <p class="block-quote">
                    Imagine you‚Äôve just completed a business trip, and now you need to submit receipts for
                    reimbursement. The finance team must verify each receipt, ensure compliance, initiate reimbursement
                    and push approved expenses into the company‚Äôs accounting books.

                    Fyle streamlines this entire process‚Äîhandling everything from receipt collection to approval,
                    verification, and accounting integration‚Äî<span class="highlighter">so businesses can manage expenses
                        with ease</span>.
                </p>
                <p>
                    To fully leverage Fyle‚Äôs capabilities, businesses need to configure their accounts based on their
                    specific workflows and policies. That‚Äôs where the product account setup team comes in.
                </p>
                <p>
                    For years, onboarding at Fyle was a <b class="highlighter">high-touch, guided process</b>. The
                    account setup team assisted businesses in configuring their accounts‚Äîa process that typically took
                    <b>1.5 months per business</b>, covering:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Inviting employees to the expense management platform</li>
                    <li>Assigning approvers (with varying complexity based on company size)</li>
                    <li>Configuring compliance policies</li>
                    <li>Setting up accounting integrations</li>
                </ul>
                <p>This approach worked well‚Äîuntil Fyle landed a <span class="highlighter">multi-million dollar
                        deal</span> as part of its new embedded platform offering.
                    With the embedded platform, any large business could launch its own expense management solution,
                    fully powered by Fyle, while maintaining its own brand guidelines.
                    The corporate card program under our banking partner already had <b>600K to 800K customers</b> and
                    <b>2,000+ organizations</b> that needed onboarding.
                    <span class="highlighter"> üö® Our existing approach wouldn‚Äôt scale.</span>
                </p>
                <p> With a committed deadline for testing the closed beta, we had to reimagine onboarding from the
                    ground up‚Äîdesigning, testing, and handing off a self-serve, scalable solution <b>within just 1.5
                        months</b>.</p>
                <h3>Framing the Problem</h3>
                <p class="block-quote">
                    How might we design a self-serve onboarding experience that reduces account setup time, enabling
                    businesses to realize value faster?
                </p>
                <h4>Success Metrics</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li> Self-Serve Completion Rate in closed beta: ‚â•<b> 80%</b></li>
                    <li> Reduce account setup time from 1.5 months to under <b>15 minutes</b></li>
                    <li> Positive Usability Feedback in external usability testing: ‚â• <b>90%</b></li>
                </ul>
                <h4>My role</h4>
                <p>
                    As the design owner, I led the <span class="highlighter">high-level interactions and user
                        flows</span> to accelerate delivery while my colleague focused on execution details.
                    I facilitated cross-functional collaboration through the design phase,
                    working closely with internal engineering teams, and <b>banking partner's product, design, and
                        engineering teams</b>.
                </p>
                <h3>Solving the problem</h3>
                <p>During our <strong>kickoff call</strong>, we aligned on key strategies to make onboarding seamless
                    and scalable.</p>
                <h4>Key strategies</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Enabling users to onboard at their own pace</strong> ‚Äì Instead of forcing a rigid setup
                        process, we allowed users to log in, initiate setup whenever they were ready, and freely explore
                        the product. This ensured onboarding remained non-blocking.</li>

                    <li><strong>Keeping the existing product functionality intact</strong> ‚Äì Rather than overhauling
                        core features, we optimized the experience within the current system, ensuring minimal
                        engineering effort.</li>

                    <li><strong>Addressing the biggest friction point‚Äîapproval setup</strong> ‚Äì Through analysis, we
                        found that the approval setup process required frequent CS team intervention. However, a
                        complete backend fix wasn‚Äôt feasible within our timeline. Instead, we redesigned the interface
                        experience to simplify onboarding without altering backend logic.</li>

                    <li><strong>Leveraging competitive insights</strong> ‚Äì To avoid reinventing the wheel, we analyzed
                        B2B onboarding flows from industry-leading products and extracted best practices.</li>

                    <li><strong>Understanding real-world use cases</strong> ‚Äì We engaged Account Managers to gather
                        insights on how businesses typically approached onboarding. This helped us refine our approach
                        and ensure our solution met user needs effectively.</li>
                    <li><strong>Building a Design System</strong> as per embedded client's branding guidline and using
                        the same for HFD </li>

                </ul>

                <h3>Design Decisions & Execution</h3>
                <h4>Exploring Solutions</h4>
                <p>As per our strategic decisions, we redesigned the onboarding experience, allowing users to complete
                    the setup at their own pace. The goal was simple‚Äîreduce friction and let them explore the product
                    without feeling blocked.</p>
                <p>NB: I will share <span class="highlighter">limited screenshots of onboarding designs without brand logo</span> as part of
                    the contract. Occasionally, <span class="highlighter">I will share screenshots of the Fyle platform as a reference</span>. The embedded platform is an exact replica of Fyle, except for the client's branding guidelines. </p>
                <h5>The Plan</h5>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Shortlist necessary steps</strong> ‚Äì Invite employees, assign approvers, set up
                        policies, and configure integrations.</li>
                    <li><strong>Guide users step by step</strong> ‚Äì Allow them to move forward only after completing the
                        current step.</li>
                    <li><strong>Redirect them seamlessly</strong> ‚Äì Take users to the relevant module for setup, and
                        nudge them toward the next step.</li>
                </ul>

                <p>Everything seemed to be falling into place. But as always, reality had other plans. üòÖ</p>

                <img src="../img/starting-point.jpg" alt="">

                <h4> 1Ô∏è‚É£ Step 01: Invite Employees‚Äî Hitting with Complexity</h4>

                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Initial approach:</strong> Redirect users to the Employee Page to invite their team
                        members.</li>
                    <li><strong>Problem:</strong> This module wasn‚Äôt just about inviting employees‚Äîit had features like
                        <span class="highlighter">assigning approvers, employee status management, bulk edits, and exports</span> etc and these actions weren't 
                        absolutly necessary for onboarding. It could easily confuse the first time users.</li>
                    <li><strong>Nuanced Take:</strong> Could we hide those advanced features and reveal them <span class="highlighter">progressively</span>?
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>Issue:</strong> When and how do we reveal them without confusing users later? </li>
                </ul>

                <p>We parked this problem and moved to the next step.</p>

                <img src="../img/employee.jpg" alt="employee">
                <figcaption>The unnecessary information & actions during onboarding.
                </figcaption>

                <h4>2Ô∏è‚É£ Step 02: Setting Up Policies‚Äî More Complexity</h4>
                <p>Policies in Fyle were inherently complex, often requiring Customer Success intervention.
                    Hence simplifying the policy set up was absolutly necessary. Instead of thinking through redesigning it, 
                    we digged deeper into data to find the most used condition.
                </p>

                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Data Insight:</strong></strong> Receipt settings were the most commonly used. (~85%).
                        In US, some orgs needed receipt above certain amount, some made it mandatory and a few never needed them.</li>
                    <li><strong>But the problem</strong> how do we highlight receipt settings alone? What about the
                        other conditions? When would they appear?</li>
                </ul>

                <p>We ran into the <span class="highlighter">same problem as in Step 1</span>.</p>

                <img src="../img/policies 1.jpg" alt="">
                <figcaption>Policy page: Receipt settings and other conditions</figcaption>

                <h4>3Ô∏è‚É£ Step 03: Approval Setup</h4>
                <p>The approval workflow setup was previously buried under the Policies Page, making it almost
                    undiscoverable.</p>

                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Win!</strong> After discussions with engineering, we got approval to separate the
                        approval flow from policies‚Äîwithout changing backend logic.</li>
                       <ul>
                        <li> <img src="../img/approver in policy page.jpg" alt="approver"></li>
                       </ul>
                    <li><strong>However, approval workflows varied across organizations:</strong></li>
                    <ul>
                        <li>üîπ Some had a single primary approver.</li>
                        <li>üîπ Others had multi-stage approvals with conditions.</li>
                    </ul>
                </ul>

                <p>We explored multiple variations, but something always felt off as <span class="highlighter">the IA looked complex</span>.</p>
                <img src="../img/early-approver.jpg" alt="">
                <figcaption>Early approval workflow</figcaption>
               

                <h4>4Ô∏è‚É£ Step 04: Integrations</h4>
                <p>Unlike other steps, integration setup was entirely self-serve. However, it took an average of 15
                    minutes to complete‚Äîrequiring focused effort.</p>

                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Key insight:</strong> Instead of pushing users to set up integrations upfront, we could
                        prompt them after they had completed fundamental settings.</li>
                    <li><strong>Small yet impactful tweak ‚Äì</strong> Introducing a new default setting where expenses would
                        be automatically submitted on behalf of the spender. This removed unnecessary friction.</li>
                </ul>

                <h4>Pivot</h4>
                <p>By Week 3, it became painfully clear‚ÄîSolution 01 wasn‚Äôt going to work.</p>

                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Why?</strong></li>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Settings are a one-time setup‚ÄîUsers rarely revisit them.</li>
                        <li>Progressive disclosure wasn‚Äôt the right approach for solving step 01 and step 02‚ÄîHiding things initially made future access
                            unintuitive.</li>
                    </ul>
                </ul>

                <p>It was clear-we needed to <span class="highlighter">change our strategy</span>.</p>
                <p class="font-18 block-quote">What if we asked users to finish the basic settings first and then
                    explore the product?</p>

                <h3>Final Solution Approach</h3>
                <h5>Engineering Trade-Offs & A Fresh Perspective</h5>
                <p>This approach meant the engineering team couldn't reuse existing pages. To move forward, we created
                    rough wireframes for different pages and met with the internal engineering team for further
                    discussions.</p>

                <p>We found a <span class="highlighter">trade-off</span>. We decided to maintain a similar structure to the existing pages while building
                    entirely new ones. Having a similar structure brings a sense of familiarity and ease of navigation.
                </p>

                <p>Coming back to the designs, here‚Äôs how we structured our approach:</p>
                <h5>Building the Design System</h5>
                <p>In embedded offerings, the product must adhere to the client's branding guidelines. Because Fyle's design system is token-based, we were able to create a new design system following the client's guidelines <b>in just two days.</b> </p>
                <img src="../img/ds.jpg" alt="">
                <figcaption>The tokens in design system</figcaption>
                
                <h5>Onboarding entry point</h5>
                <p>Once launched, the user lands on a welcome page. They can either delegate the entire flow or set up the account on their own..</p>
                <img src="../img/new-entry.jpg" alt="">

                <h5>Employee Page</h5>
                <p>
                After interacting with "Manage Roles," the user landed on a new employee page, designed with a similar structure like actual employee page and required information in mind.

                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>To further simplify user onboarding, we <b>imported</b> all users from the banking partner as <b>Spenders automatically</b>. </li>
                    <li>By changing our approach, the interface became more intuitive, saving us from writing numerous
                        conditional blocks.</li>
                </ul>
                <img src="../img/new-employee.jpg" alt="employee">
                <h5>Receipt Page</h5>
                <ul>
                    <li>Following the same streamlined approach as the Employee Page, we further simplified this
                        interface using <b>the data insights.</b></li>
                    <li>Unlike Fyle, we provided 3 explicit receipt options for the users.</li>
                </ul>

                <img src="../img/new receipt.jpg" alt="">

                <h5>Approval Page</h5>
                <ul>
                    <li><b>New approach: </b> After analyzing the data, we found that businesses <span class="highlighter">primarily use single-stage approval</span>. When a second-stage approval is used, it is mostly based on <b>amount conditions</b>. The third-stage approval system was not an immediate need. Therefore, by default, we assigned the admin as the primary approver and provided a CTA to add a second-stage approver. This simplified the interface. </li>
                  
                </ul>
                <img src="../img/new-approver.jpg" alt="">

                <h5>Successful onboarding and the dashboard</h5>
                 <ul>
                    <li>The integration setup nudges were moved to the dashboard.</li>
                    <li>The essential tasks for the admin, which were previously available in another mode, were made explicit on the dashboard.</li>
                 </ul>
                <img src="../img/succes.jpg" alt="">
                <h5>Extenal Usability Testing</h5>
                    <p>We presented our approach to the banking partner team, and they approved the designs.</p>
                    <p>Following that, the team proceeded with external usability testing.</p>
                   
                    <p>Through testing, we found that while users could complete the setup in less than 5 minutes (or even faster), 
                        some struggled with terminology like "receipt settings, expense reporting etc" 
                        They also wondered whether they could set it up later 
                    if they skipped it now, which created a sense of compulsion to proceed with the default settings.
                    </p>
                
                    <p> My colleague took the lead in addressing this feedback later.</p>

                <h5>Closed Beta launch and General Availability</h5>
                   
                    <p>After the usability test, the team implemented the feedback, launched the closed beta, and then proceeded with General Availability (GA).</p>
                    <p>I tracked key KPIs throughout the process, and the results validated our success‚Äîhitting our target metrics gave us the confidence to move forward with GA as planned.</p>

                <h3>Impact So Far</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>NPS:<b>61</b></li>
                    <li>Total orgs onboarded: <b>700+</b></li>
                    <li>Total expenses processed:  <b>$353.33M</b></li>
                </ul>
                <p>It is just the beginning of something great. With this initiative, we <span class="highlighter"> laid the foundation for Fyle's embedded product offering.</span>
                It opened the door for <span class="highlighter">collaboration with other big clients.</span>
                </p>
                <h3>Key Learnings</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Pivot when things don't work.</li>
                    <li>Document the flow, even if it already exists in the product‚Äîit helps developers move faster. We experienced some back-and-forth even after the handoff was completed.
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <p class="mt-5 fira-code pt-5">Thank you for making it so far!</p>
