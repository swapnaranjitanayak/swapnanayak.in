                <p class="block-quote">Fyle is an expense management platform that streamlines the entire process from
                    submitting receipts to reimbursement. It helps businesses efficiently handle receipt collection,
                    approval workflows, compliance verification, and accounting integration.</p>


            
                <h3>Problem Discovery</h3>

                <p>
                    For years, onboarding at Fyle followed a <b class="highlighter">high-touch, guided process</b>. The
                    account setup team personally assisted businesses in configuring their accounts‚Äîa process that
                    typically took
                    <b>1.5 months per business.</b> This approach was effective but not scalable.
                </p>

                <p>The breaking point came when Fyle secured a <span class="highlighter">multi-million dollar
                        deal</span> as part of its new embedded platform offering.
                    The corporate card program under our banking partner already had <b>600K to 800K customers</b> and
                    <b>2,000+ organizations</b> that needed onboarding. Our existing high-touch approach simply couldn't
                    scale to meet this demand.
                </p>
                <h3>Framing the Challenge</h3>
                <p class="block-quote">
                    How might Fyle design a self-serve onboarding experience that reduces account setup time from 1.5
                    months to minutes, enabling
                    businesses to realize value faster?
                </p>
                <h3>My role</h3>
                <p>
                    I <span class="highlighter">led the product and design phase</span> of this initiative, bringing in
                    an experienced designer with product knowledge across the modules. I facilitated <span
                        class="highlighter">collaboration</span> between Fyle's designers and engineers while
                    coordinating critique sessions with product and design teams from our first embedded offering
                    customers. To meet tight deadlines, I personally developed the <span class="highlighter">high-level
                        interactions and flows</span> before transitioning execution to my colleague.
                </p>
                <h3>Approach & Strategy</h3>
                <p> With the limited timeline, I thought through the problems and constraints before the kick off call multiple times and  developed key strategies to ensure we delivered meaningful outcomes while
                    working within our constraints.
                </p>

                <h4>Key strategies</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Enabling users to onboard at their own pace</strong> ‚Äì Instead of forcing a rigid setup
                        process, we allowed users to log in, initiate setup whenever they were ready, and freely explore
                        the product. This ensured onboarding remained non-blocking.</li>

                    <li><strong>Keeping the existing product functionality intact</strong> ‚Äì Rather than overhauling
                        core features, we optimized the experience within the current system, ensuring minimal
                        engineering effort.</li>

                    <li><strong>Addressing the biggest friction point‚Äîapproval setup</strong> ‚Äì Through analysis, we
                        found that the approval setup process required frequent CS team intervention. However, a
                        complete backend fix wasn't feasible within our timeline. Instead, we redesigned the interface
                        experience to simplify onboarding without altering backend logic.</li>

                    <li><strong>Leveraging competitive insights</strong> ‚Äì To avoid reinventing the wheel, we analyzed
                        B2B onboarding flows from industry-leading products and extracted best practices.</li>

                    <li><strong>Understanding real-world use cases</strong> ‚Äì We engaged Account Managers to gather
                        insights on how businesses typically approached onboarding. This helped us refine our approach
                        and ensure our solution met user needs effectively.</li>
                    <li><strong>Building a Design System</strong> as per embedded client's branding guideline and using
                        the same for high-fidelity designs.</li>

                </ul>
                <p>These strategies helped me successfully align stakeholders during our kickoff call, creating a shared
                    understanding of our approach.</p>

                <h3>Iterations & Learning Cycles</h3>
                <h4>Iteration 1: The Sequential Approach</h4>
                <p>My initial plan followed a logical sequence: identify necessary steps, guide users through them one
                    by one, and redirect them to relevant modules. I believed this would create a smooth, step-by-step
                    experience. The plan included:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Shortlist necessary steps</strong> ‚Äì Invite employees, assign approvers, set up
                        policies, and configure integrations.</li>
                    <li><strong>Guide users step by step</strong> ‚Äì Allow them to move forward only after completing the
                        current step.</li>
                    <li><strong>Redirect them seamlessly</strong> ‚Äì Take users to the relevant module for setup, and
                        nudge them toward the next step.</li>
                </ul>

                <p>Everything seemed logical on paper. But as we began exploring each step in detail, complexity
                    emerged.</p>



                <h4> 1Ô∏è‚É£ Step 01: Invite Employees‚Äî Hitting with Complexities</h4>

                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Initial approach:</strong> Redirect users to the Employee Page to invite their team
                        members.</li>
                    <li><strong>Problem discovered:</strong> This module wasn't just about inviting employees‚Äîit had
                        features like
                        <span class="highlighter">assigning approvers, employee status management, bulk edits, and
                            exports</span> that weren't
                        absolutely necessary for onboarding. These could easily overwhelm first-time users.
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>Nuanced exploration:</strong> Could we hide those advanced features and reveal them
                        <span class="highlighter">progressively</span>?
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>New question:</strong> When and how do we reveal them without confusing users later?
                    </li>
                </ul>

                <p>As a team, we temporarily parked this problem and moved to the next step, hoping a pattern would emerge.</p>



                <h4>2Ô∏è‚É£ Step 02: Setting Up Policies‚Äî Deeper Complexity</h4>
                <p>Policies in Fyle were inherently complex, often requiring Customer Success intervention.
                    Simplifying policy setup was absolutely necessary. Instead of immediately redesigning it,
                    we <span class="highlighter">dug deeper into data</span> to find the most commonly used conditions.
                </p>

                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Data Insight:</strong><span class="highlighter"> Receipt settings</span> were
                        the most commonly used policy condition (~85%).
                        In the US, some organizations needed receipts above certain amounts, some made them mandatory,
                        and a few never
                        required them.</li>
                    <li><strong>New questions:</strong> How do we highlight receipt settings without overwhelming users
                        with other conditions? When would these other conditions appear?</li>
                </ul>

                <h4>3Ô∏è‚É£ Step 03: Approval Setup</h4>
                <p>The approval workflow setup was previously buried under the Policies Page, <span
                        class="highlighter">making it almost
                        undiscoverable</span>.</p>

                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Win!</strong> After discussions with engineering, we got approval to separate the
                        approval flow from policies‚Äî<span class="highlighter">without changing backend logic.</span>
                    </li>

                    <li><strong>However, approval workflows varied across organizations:</strong></li>
                    <ul>
                        <li>üîπ Some had a single primary approver.</li>
                        <li>üîπ Others had multi-stage approvals with conditions.</li>
                    </ul>
                </ul>

                <p>My colleague explored multiple variations, but something always felt off as <span class="highlighter">the
                        information architecture
                        looked complex</span>.</p>
                <img src="../img/early-approver.jpg" alt="">
                <figcaption>Early approval workflow exploration</figcaption>

                <p>
                    A <span class="highlighter">key trade-off emerged here</span>: fully supporting multi-stage
                    approvals would have required significant backend changes, which wasn't feasible. 

                </p>
                <p>
                    <span class="highlighter">I advocated </span>for
                    prioritizing single-stage setups based on data showing it mets 93.42% of use cases, convincing the
                    banking partner to defer complex workflows to a post-launch phase.
                </p>

                <h4>4Ô∏è‚É£ Step 04: Integrations</h4>
                <p>Unlike other steps, integration setup was entirely self-serve. However, it took an average of 15
                    minutes to complete‚Äîrequiring focused effort.</p>

                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Key insight:</strong> Instead of pushing users to set up integrations upfront, we could
                        prompt them after they had completed fundamental settings.</li>
                </ul>

                <h4>The Pivot</h4>
                <p>By Week 3, it became painfully clear‚Äîour initial approach wasn't going to work.</p>

                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Why?</strong></li>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Settings are a one-time setup‚ÄîUsers rarely revisit them.</li>
                        <li>Progressive disclosure wasn't the right approach for solving step 01 and step 02‚ÄîHiding
                            features initially made future access unintuitive.</li>
                        <li>Redirecting to existing complex pages created more confusion than clarity.</li>
                    </ul>
                </ul>

                <p> <span class="highlighter">I needed to change our strategy</span> fundamentally.</p>
                <p class="font-18 block-quote">What if we asked users to finish the basic settings first in a dedicated
                    onboarding experience and then explore the product?</p>

                <h3>Final Solution: Prioritizing Core Actions</h3>
                <h5>Engineering Trade-Offs & A Fresh Perspective</h5>
                <p>This approach meant the engineering team couldn't reuse existing pages. To move forward,
                    <span class="highlighter"> I created
                        rough wireframes for different pages</span> and met with the internal engineering team for further
                    discussions. A tension arose when engineering <span class="highlighter">pushed back on</span> building new pages due to time
                    constraints. I <span class="highlighter">negotiated a compromise</span> by aligning the new structure with existing patterns,
                    reducing their workload while maintaining user clarity.
                </p>


                <p>Coming back to the designs, here's how I structured our approach:</p>
                <h5>Building the <span class="highlighter">Design System</span></h5>
                <p>In embedded offerings, the product must adhere to the client's branding guidelines. Because Fyle's
                    design system is token-based, I was able to create a new design system following the client's
                    guidelines <b>in just two days.</b> I pulled in another colleague to give us the god speed.</p>

                <h5>User Initiating the Setup</h5>
                <p>Once launched, the user lands on a welcome page. They can either delegate the entire flow or set up
                    the account on their own.
                    Here are a few screenshots of the manual setup flow:
                </p>

                <p>User's essential tasks for faster time to value in manual setup process:</p>
                <img src="../img/new-entry.jpg" alt="" class="img-fluid">
                <h5>Inviting Employees</h5>
                <p>
                    After interacting with "Manage Roles," the user landed on a new employee page, designed with a
                    similar structure to the actual employee page but focused only on required information.

                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>To further simplify user onboarding, we <b>imported</b> all users from the banking partner as
                        <b>Spenders automatically</b>.
                    </li>
                    <li>By changing our approach, the interface became more intuitive, <span class="highlighter">saving
                            us from writing numerous
                            conditional blocks in backend.</span></li>
                </ul>
                <img src="../img/new-employee.jpg" alt="employee">
                <h5>Setting Up Policies</h5>
                <p>
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Following the same streamlined approach as the Employee Page, we further simplified this
                        interface using <b>the data insights</b>. Instead of overwhelming users with a bulk set of
                        policy conditions,
                        we focused on <span class="highlighter">receipt</span> conditions alone (~85% of organizations
                        use
                        this condition).</li>
                    <li>Unlike the main Fyle product, we simplified the receipt settings with 3 explicit receipt options
                        for users.</li>
                </ul>

                <h5>Setting Up Approvers</h5>
                <p>Note: Skipping the automated expense report setup as it was straightforward.
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li><b>New approach: </b> After analyzing the data, I found that businesses <span
                            class="highlighter">primarily use single-stage approval</span>. When a second-stage approval
                        is used, it is mostly based on <b>amount conditions</b>. The third-stage approval system was not
                        an immediate need. Therefore, by default, I took <span class="highlighter">the product call</span>:  Assigning the admin as the primary approver.
                        We provided a CTA to add a second-stage approver. This significantly simplified the interface.
                    </li>

                </ul>
                <img src="../img/new-approver.jpg" alt="">

                <h5>Successful Setup</h5>
                <ul>
                    <li>The integration setup nudges were moved to the dashboard.</li>
                    <li>The essential tasks for the admin, which were previously available in another mode, were made
                        explicit on the dashboard.</li>
                </ul>
                <img src="../img/succes.jpg" alt="">
                <h3>External Usability Testing</h3>
                <p><span class="highlighter">I presented</span> our approach to the banking partner team, who approved the designs.</p>
                <p>Following that, the team proceeded with external usability testing.</p>

                <p>Through testing, we found that while users could complete the setup in <span class="highlighter">less
                        than 5 minutes (or even
                        faster),</span>
                    some <span class="highlighter">struggled</span> with terminology like "receipt settings" and
                    "expense reporting."
                    They also <span class="highlighter">wondered</span> whether they could set it up later
                    if they skipped it now, which created a sense of compulsion to proceed with the default settings.
                </p>

                <p>My colleague took the lead in addressing this feedback for the final implementation.</p>

                <h3>Closed Beta Launch and General Availability</h3>

                <p>After incorporating usability feedback, the team launched the closed beta, and then
                    proceeded with General Availability (GA).</p>
                <p>I tracked key KPIs (set up by the engineers and a PM) throughout the process, and the results
                    validated our success‚Äîhitting our target
                    metrics gave us the confidence to move forward with GA as planned.</p>

                <h3>Impact</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>NPS:<b>61</b></li>
                    <li>Total orgs onboarded: <b>700+</b></li>
                    <li>Total expenses processed: <b>$353.33M</b></li>
                </ul>

                <p>It is just the beginning of something great. With this initiative, we <span class="highlighter"> laid
                        the foundation for <a
                            href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/fyle_expensemanagement-fintech-payroll-activity-7237464260954480641-5tv5?utm_source=share&utm_medium=member_desktop&rcm=ACoAAAui9dABQDS1Db46jTw-ZBdQXaqiBB0T2k8"
                            target="_blank">Fyle's embedded </a> product offering.</span>
                    It opened the door for <span class="highlighter">collaboration with other big clients.</span>
                </p>
                <h3>Key Learnings</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Pivot when things don't work.</li>
                    <li>Document the flow, even if it already exists in the product‚Äîit helps developers move faster. We
                        experienced some back-and-forth even after the handoff was completed.
                        This experience taught me to preemptively align documentation with engineering sprints, a
                        practice I now apply to ensure smoother handoffs in scalable projects.
                    </li>
                </ul>
