                <p class="block-quote">Fyle is an expense management platform that streamlines the entire process from
                    submitting receipts to reimbursement. It helps businesses efficiently handle receipt collection,
                    approval workflows, compliance verification, and accounting integration.
        
                <h3>Problem Discovery</h3>
                <p>
                    At first glance, spender (employees who spend money) activation at Fyle seemed straightforwardâ€”admins invited employees, and they started expensing. But something was off.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Usability testing on embedded admin onboarding revealed a troubling pattern: admins, who were supposed to guide spenders, struggled with fundamental expense concepts. If admins found it confusing, how could new spenders navigate with ease?
                   <span class="highlighter"> I briefly discussed</span> this with the PM, Gayathiri.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Digging into data post-beta launch, we (product took a lead) uncovered bigger issues:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Spenders weren't opting into text message receipts.</li>
                    <li>
                        They weren't connecting their payment cards.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Tasks on the homepage were ignored.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Manual uploads became the default, making expense reporting tedious.
                    </li>
                </ul>
               <p>
                If spenders weren't <span class="highlighter">engaging with Fyle's core automation features</span>, their <span class="highlighter">time to value</span> was significantly delayed (~22 days for first expense creation). This wasn't just a usability issueâ€”it impacted activation, retention, and the broader Product-Led Growth (PLG) strategy.
               </p>
                <h3>My Role</h3>
                <p>Working closely with the Product Manager, I:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><b>Led</b> the exploratory design process to identify the key friction points</li>
                    <li>Mapped the <b>complete user journey</b> from signup to product usage</li>
                    <li>Brought <b>consistency</b> to the visual language and experience</li>
                    <li>Onboarded and <b>mentored a designer</b> who would execute the plan</li>
                    <li>Guided the team through thinking about <b>different solutions and edge cases</b></li>
                    <li>Created <b>opportunities</b> for the designer to present to leadership</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Beyond design execution, I worked to <span class="highlighter">influence leadership buy-in</span> and align the initiative with
                    long-term product goals.</p>

                <h3>Approach & Iterations</h3>
                <p>Without formal frameworks, we relied on <b>practical problem-solving and quick learning cycles.</b>
                I've covered <span class="highlighter">core flows</span> here instead of end-to-end flow.</p>

                <h4>Iteration 1: Exploring Tooltip Guides, a quick miss</h4>
                <p>My first suggestion was straightforward: use tooltips to introduce spenders to the interface,
                    explaining terminology like expenses, reports, and policies etc. for all modules <span class="highlighter">progressively</span>. Testing quickly revealed this wasn't
                    workingâ€”<span class="highlighter">users instinctively closed tooltips</span> and preferred to explore on their own. The approach lacked engagement.</p>
                <img src="../img/tooltip-walkthrough.png" alt="tooltip">
                <figcaption>A sample tooltip walkthrough screen</figcaption>
                <img src="../img/tooltip 2.png" alt="tooltip 2">
                <figcaption>Another sample tooltip walkthrough screen for a different module</figcaption>
                
                <h3>Influencing the product strategy</h3>

                <p>After this, Fyle transitioned to a new quarter and henceforth to a new roadmap as well <span class="highlighter">with revised strategic decisions</span>, bringing this initiative close to <span class="highlighter">being dropped</span>.
                     I advocated for its <b>long-term value</b>. I emphasized how this initiative would strengthen Fyle's <b>embedded offering business</b>, providing value to both the spender and the business.
                </p>

                <h3>Iteration 2: Exploring Sample Expense, the hidden complexity</h3>
                <p>I collaborated with the designer and PM on the roadblocks. Product recommended providing a sample expense solution to help spenders visualize what an expense looks like. 
                    To note, as a team we wanted to leverage what we have in our product rather than introducing any new screen and interface as it affects the speed.
                    </p>
                    <p>However,
                        discussions with <span class="highlighter">engineering</span> revealed practical challenges:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>How would auto-submission rules handle the sample?</li>
                    <li>Would sample expenses need to be auto-deleted?</li>
                    <li>Would dummy amounts impact report totals?</li>
                    <li>Could this approach create confusion for users?</li>
                    <li>How would we show sample status?</li>
                </ul>
                <p>The complexity <span class="highlighter">outweighed the benefits</span>, leading us to <b>pivot</b>.</p>

                <img src="../img/sample expense.png" alt="sample expense">
                <figcaption>Exploration of sample expense</figcaption>
                

                <h3>Iteration 3: Prioritizing Core Actions</h3>
                <p>Stepping back, we (product and design brainstormed again) <span class="highlighter">reassessed</span> what truly defined value for a spender.
                    We reframed the goal: <b>Instead of teaching users about expenses, let's get them to create one faster.</b> </p>
                    
                    <p>
                        <b>Data</b> showed users weren't
                        entering their mobile number and card details, <span class="highlighter">delaying access</span> to our most valuable
                        featureâ€”<b>automated receipt tracking.</b>
                    </p>

                <p>
                   <span class="highlighter">I reinvestigated</span> onboarding of other products and considered incorporating the learnings from <span class="highlighter">Slack's onboarding.</span>
                    Unlike others, Slack helps users create a workspace before they even use the product. <span class="highlighter">Users take action before even exploring the product.</span> 
                    This was our takeaway.
                </p>


                <h5>Key strategies</h5>
                <p>I brainstormed with my colleague and redesigned the onboarding flow to prioritize these two actions:</p>
            
                <ul>
                    <li>Simplified card connection to focus only on Visa and MasterCard</li>
                    <li>Help users in opting into the text message</li>
                </ul>

                <p>Post onboarding, <span class="highlighter">I emphasized</span> welcoming the user in the product and helping them understand the different ways to send receipts to Fyle and how Fyle takes care of the rest.
                   In the next phase of release, along with the product team, we decided to use progressive disclosure to introduce different concepts around expenses to the spender.
                </p>
                <p>
                Alongside, we <span class="highlighter">de-prioritized</span> a few other actions intentionally. The intention was to <span class="highlighter">start small. </span>
                </p>
                
                <h5>But...</h5>
                <p>The valid question I came up with is, why would a spender like to connect a card or opt into the text message? 
                What is the motivation? We needed to explain the value - It was evident.
                </p>


                <p>After a few variations around <span class="highlighter">layout, structure and copy</span>, both my designer colleague and I finalized the following version for our two most 
                    important actions.
                </p>


                <h5>Core flows</h5>

                <ul>
                    <li>User accepts the invite from Admin
                    </li>
                    <li>User logs in
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        User lands on the connect card flows
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <img src="../img/connect card.gif" alt="">
                <figcaption>Connect card UI</figcaption>

                <img src="../img/opt in.gif" alt="opt in">
                <figcaption>Opt in to text message UI</figcaption>

                <img src="../img/welcome.png" alt="welcome">
                <figcaption>The welcome screen</figcaption>

                <p>
                    Here, I've represented the core flows, whereas our end-to-end flow covered various edge cases. To give you a sense, this is how our Figma file looked during handoff.
                </p>
                <img src="../img/messy paths.png" alt="">
                <figcaption></figcaption>

                <h4>Impact</h4>
                <p>The redesigned onboarding dramatically improved key metrics:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Time to opt into text-based receipts: <b>288 hrs â†’ 7 minutes</b></li>
                    <li>Card connection time: <b>474 hours â†’ 12 minutes</b></li>
                    <li>Time to save the 1st expense (direct time to value): <b>22 days -> 16 days</b></li>
                </ul>
                <p>Beyond short-term activation, this onboarding flow laid the foundation for a <span class="highlighter">scalable self-serve
                    model</span>, reducing customer support dependency and improving <span class="highlighter">long-term retention.</span></p>

                <p>
                    We extended the onboarding to the <span class="highlighter">Mobile App Platform. </span>
                </p>

                <h4>Key Learnings</h4>
                <h5>On Design Process</h5>
                <ul>
                    <li>In small organizations, <span class="highlighter">pragmatic exploration</span> often yields better results than rigid frameworks.
                    </li>
                    <li>The first approach rarely works, but each attempt teaches <b>valuable lessons.</b></li>
                    <li><b>Simplicity</b> consistently outperforms complexity in driving user adoption.</li>
                </ul>

                <h5>On Design Leadership</h5>
                <ul>
                    <li>Advocating for user value sometimes means <b>fighting to keep initiatives alive.</b></li>
                    <li>Mentorship happens in the trenchesâ€”guiding others through edge cases and real-world constraints.
                    </li>
                    <li>Creating opportunities for team members to present to leadership builds their confidence and
                        visibility.</li>
                </ul>

                <h5>On Decision Making</h5>
                <p>All our decisions balanced four key considerations:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><b>User value:</b> How would this improve the spender experience?</li>
                    <li><b>Business impact:</b> How would this affect our key metrics?</li>
                    <li><b>Technical feasibility:</b> What was practically possible with our resources?</li>
                    <li><b>Strategic alignment:</b> How did this support our product direction?</li>
                </ul>
                <p>This project reinforced that great product design doesn't require extensive frameworksâ€”it requires
                    clear focus on user needs, business outcomes, and practical solutions. In a small organization, the
                    ability to <span class="highlighter">navigate ambiguity, learn quickly, and execute pragmatically</span> is often more valuable than
                    perfect process adherence.</p>
