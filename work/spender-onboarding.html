                    <h1>Spender Onboarding</h1>
                    <p class="supporting-text">Designing a self-serve spender onboarding at Fyle through <span class="highlighter">pragmatic leadership</span>.
                    </p>
            </div>
            <div class="blog-content">

                <p class="block-quote">Fyle is an expense management platform that streamlines the entire process from
                    submitting receipts to reimbursement. It helps businesses efficiently handle receipt collection,
                    approval workflows, compliance verification, and accounting integration.
                    After successfully redesigning our <a href="admin-onboarding.html" target="_blank">admin onboarding</a> flow, we <span class="highlighter">naturally turned our attention</span> to
                    spenders—employees who submit expenses.</p>
        
                <h3>Problem Discovery</h3>
                <p>The journey to improving spender onboarding wasn't as straightforward as we initially thought. It
                    began as a <span class="highlighter"> natural extension of our admin onboarding work </span>, but the full scope of the problem
                    revealed itself through parallel discovery:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>During admin onboarding <span class="highlighter">usability testing</span>, we unexpectedly observed that spenders were
                        struggling with fundamental concepts — what is expense report, how does it work, creating expenses manually etc.
                        </li>
                    <li>Simultaneously, our <span class="highlighter">data</span> revealed concerning patterns: users weren't opting into <b>text message
                        receipts</b> or <b>connecting their payment cards</b>—core features that drove our <span class="highlighter">platform's value</span>.</li>
                    <li>We noticed spenders <b>ignored</b> tasks on the homepage and many defaulted to manual uploads, making
                        their experience <span class="highlighter">cumbersome</span>.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Beyond these immediate issues, we recognized that fixing spender onboarding would improve <b>activation & retention</b>
                    aligning with Fyle’s larger <span class="highlighter">business goals for PLG.</span></p>

                <h3>My Role</h3>
                <p>Working closely with the Product Manager, I:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><b>Led</b> the exploratory design process to identify the key friction points</li>
                    <li>Mapped the <b>complete user journey</b> from signup to product usage</li>
                    <li>Brought <b>consistency</b> to the visual language and experience</li>
                    <li>Onboarded and <b>mentored a designer</b> who would execute the plan</li>
                    <li>Guided the team through thinking about <b>different edge cases</b></li>
                    <li>Created <b>opportunities</b> for the designer to present to leadership</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Beyond design execution, I worked to <span class="highlighter">influence leadership buy-in</span> and align the initiative with
                    long-term product goals.</p>

                <h3>Approach & Iterations</h3>
                <p>Without formal frameworks, we relied on <b>practical problem-solving and quick learning cycles.</b>
                I've covered <span class="highlighter">core flows</span> here instead of end to end flow.</p>

                <h4>Iteration 1: Exploring Tooltip Guides</h4>
                <p>Our first attempt was straightforward: use tooltips to introduce spenders to the interface,
                    explaining terminology like expenses, reports, and policies etc for all modules <span class="highlighter">progressively</span>. Testing quickly revealed this wasn't
                    working—<span class="highlighter">users instinctively closed tooltips</span> and preferred to explore on their own. The approach lacked engagement.</p>
                <img src="../img/tooltip-walkthrough.png" alt="tooltip">
                <figcaption>A sample tooltip walkthrough screen</figcaption>
                <img src="../img/tooltip 2.png" alt="tooltip 2">
                <figcaption>Another sample tooltip walkthrough screen for a different module</figcaption>
                
                <h3>Influencing the product strategy</h3>

                <p>After this, we transitioned to a new quarter and henceforth to a new roadmap as well <span class="highlighter">with revised strategic decisions</span>, bringing this initiative close to <span class="highlighter">being dropped</span>.
                     I advocated for its <b>long-term value</b>. I emphasized how this initiative would strengthen Fyle's <b>embedded offering business</b>, providing value to both the spender and the business.</b>
                </p>

                <h3>Iteration 2: Exploring Sample Expense</h3>
                <p>We explored a sample expense to help spenders visualize what an expense looks like. However,
                    discussions with <span class="highlighter">engineering</span> revealed practical challenges:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>How would auto-submission rules handle the sample?</li>
                    <li>Would sample expenses need to be auto-deleted?</li>
                    <li>Would dummy amounts impact report totals?</li>
                    <li>Could this approach create confusion for users?</li>
                    <li>How would we show sample status?</li>
                </ul>
                <p>The complexity <span class="highlighter">outweighed the benefits</span>, leading us to <b>pivot</b>.</p>

                <img src="../img/sample expense.png" alt="sample expense">
                <figcaption>Exploration of sample expense</figcaption>
                

                <h3>Iteration 3: Prioritizing Core Actions</h3>
                <p>Stepping back, we <span class="highlighter">reassessed</span> what truly defined value for a spender - it is the expense creation. 
                    The faster way of creating the expense is sending receipts via SMS. For this, user needs to conenct the card and opt into the text message.
                    
                    <b>Data</b> showed users weren't
                    entering their mobile number and card details, <span class="highlighter"> delaying access</span> to our most valuable
                    feature—<b>automated receipt tracking.</b></p>

                <p>
                    We reivestigated onboarding of other products and considered incorporating the learnings from <span class="highlighter">Slack's onboarding.</span>
                    Unlike others, Slack help user creating a workspace before even they use the product. <span class="highlighter">User takes action before even exploring the product.</span> 
                    This was our takeway.
                </p>


                <h5>Key strategies</h5>
                <p>We redesigned the onboarding flow to prioritize these two actions:</p>
            
                <ul>
                    <li>Simplified card connection to focus only on Visa and MasterCard</li>
                    <li>Help users in opting into the text message.</li>
                </ul>

                <p>Post onboarding, we decided to welcome the user and help them understand the different ways to send receipts to Fyle and how Fyle takes care of the rest.
                </p>
                <p>
                Alongside, we <span class="highlighter">de-prioritized</span> a few other actions intentionally. The intention was to <span class="highlighter">start small. </span>
                </p>
                
                <h5>But...</h5>
                <p>The valid questions we came up with is, why a spender would like to connect a card or opt into the text message? 
                What is the motivation? We needed to explain the value - It was evident.
                </p>


                <p>After a few variations around <span class="highlighter">layout, structure and copy</span>, we finalised the following version for our two most 
                    important actions. 
                </p>


                <h5>Core flows</h5>

                <ul>
                    <li>User accepts the invite from Admin
                    </li>
                    <li> User logs in
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        User lands on the connect card flows
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <img src="../img/connect card.gif" alt="">
                <figcaption>Connect card UI</figcaption>

                <img src="../img/opt in.gif" alt="opt in">
                <figcaption>Opt in to text message UI</figcaption>

                <img src="../img/welcome.png" alt="welcome">
                <figcaption>The welcome screen</figcaption>

                <p>
                    Here, I've represented the core flows, whereas our end-to-end flow covered various edge cases. To give you a sense, this is how our Figma file looked during handoff.
                </p>
                <img src="../img/messy paths.png" alt="">
                <figcaption></figcaption>

                <h4>Impact</h4>
                <p>The redesigned onboarding dramatically improved key metrics:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Time to opt into text-based receipts: <b>12 days → 2 minutes</b></li>
                    <li>Card connection time: <b>488 hours → 12 minutes</b></li>
                </ul>
                <p>Beyond short-term activation, this onboarding flow laid the foundation for a <span class="highlighter">scalable self-serve
                    model</span>, reducing customer support dependency and improving <span class="highlighter">long-term retention.</span></p>

                <p>
                    As next step, We extended the onboarding to the <span class="highlighter">Mobile App Platform. </span>
                </p>

                <h4>Key Learnings</h4>
                <h5>On Design Process</h5>
                <ul>
                    <li>In small organizations, <span class="highlighter">pragmatic exploration</span> often yields better results than rigid frameworks.
                    </li>
                    <li>The first approach rarely works, but each attempt teaches <b>valuable lessons.</b></li>
                    <li><b>Simplicity</b> consistently outperforms complexity in driving user adoption.</li>
                </ul>

                <h5>On Design Leadership</h5>
                <ul>
                    <li>Advocating for user value sometimes means <b>fighting to keep initiatives alive.</b></li>
                    <li>Mentorship happens in the trenches—guiding others through edge cases and real-world constraints.
                    </li>
                    <li>Creating opportunities for team members to present to leadership builds their confidence and
                        visibility.</li>
                </ul>

                <h5>On Decision Making</h5>
                <p>All our decisions balanced four key considerations:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><b>User value:</b> How would this improve the spender experience?</li>
                    <li><b>Business impact:</b> How would this affect our key metrics?</li>
                    <li><b>Technical feasibility:</b> What was practically possible with our resources?</li>
                    <li><b>Strategic alignment:</b> How did this support our product direction?</li>
                </ul>
                <p>This project reinforced that great product design doesn't require extensive frameworks—it requires
                    clear focus on user needs, business outcomes, and practical solutions. In a small organization, the
                    ability to <span class="highlighter"> navigate ambiguity, learn quickly, and execute pragmatically</span> is often more valuable than
                    perfect process adherence.</p>
