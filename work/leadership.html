                <h3>Summary:</h3>
                <p>I joined Fyle as a senior designer st Fyle during its early stages when the company was focused on
                    the Indian travel market. Fyle was forced to pivot to the US market during COVID, and unexpectedly
                    found iteself flooded with demo requests. There I was, still finding my footing in the product's new
                    positioning, yet suddenly thrust into <span class="highlighter">a whirlwind of change.</span> üôÇ

                </p>
                <p>
                    I stepped up to <span class="highlighter">lead design strategy</span>. Over four years, my work
                    directly contributed to Fyle's growth from <span class="highlighter">$0 to $8M+ in revenue.</span>

                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Primary Role:</strong> Senior Product Designer ‚Üí Associate Director</li>
                    <li><strong>Time Frame:</strong> 2019 - 2025</li>
                    <li><strong>Company Size:</strong> ~30 ‚Üí 150+</li>
                    <li><strong>Business Model:</strong> B2B, SaaS</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Walking Through the Flames üî•</h3>

                <p>As the most senior designer, I was entrusted with leading the team through this rapid transformation.
                    Throughout my tenure at Fyle, I <span class="highlighter">wore multiple hats</span> and embraced
                    various roles as needed.</p>

                <p>When I joined, the product and design decisions were predominantly <span class="highlighter">driven
                        by engineers</span>. They led design critiques (yes, really! :P) and offered numerous subjective
                    comments. <span class="highlighter">Designers had lost their voice</span>. There was no formal
                    design team structure, and designers couldn't collaborate with peers to gain different perspectives.
                </p>

                <p>I knew I needed to transform this culture, build a strong team, and drive strategic vision. I
                    prepared a foundational roadmap focused on three key pillars:</p>

                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Building the team</strong>: How I motivated my team and attracted top design
                        professionals.</li>
                    <li><strong>Maximizing Design Influence</strong>: How I removed obstacles and amplified my team's
                        impact.</li>
                    <li><strong>Envisioning Product Excellence</strong>: How I developed and executed a compelling
                        product vision.</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Building the Team üå±</h3>

                <p>It was a fascinating personal pivot when one day I woke up and suddenly <span class="highlighter">my
                        relationships with colleagues had transformed</span>. Though initially overwhelming, I quickly
                    adapted and focused on building what was necessary.</p>

                <h4>Establishing Meaningful Team Rituals</h4>

                <p>As we grew, I established several rituals to enhance collaboration in our remote setting and
                    strengthen team bonds:</p>

                <ul>
                    <li>ü§ù <strong>Weekly Catchups</strong>: These synchronization meetings gave us opportunities to
                        share ongoing initiatives and receive feedback.</li>
                    <li>üñåÔ∏è <strong>Design Review Process</strong>: All individual contributions went through a design
                        owner's review cycle before meeting the product team.</li>
                    <li>üé≠ <strong>Friday Showcases</strong>: Fridays featured a mix of activities‚Äîcasual hangouts, game
                        sessions, or creative product explorations.</li>
                    <li>üéì <strong>Thoughtful Onboarding</strong>: I designed a buddy system for new members to ensure
                        they never felt lost.</li>
                </ul>

                <p>These rituals helped us maintain strong camaraderie and collaboration even as our team expanded. The
                    proof? <span class="highlighter">In 2.5 years, our design team maintained a zero attrition
                        rate.</span></p>

                <h4>Nurturing Early-Career Designers</h4>

                <p>Passionate about developing emerging talent, I initiated conversations with management about creating
                    an internship program through Internshala.</p>

                <p>Over the years, <strong>we welcomed three interns, with two transitioning to full-time
                        positions.</strong></p>

                <h4>Drawing in Exceptional Talent</h4>
                <p><b>
                        Let's be honest: top designers rarely dream of working for an unfamiliar B2B SaaS company where
                        they'll spend days designing data tables. The challenge was even greater when our product
                        appeared dated.
                    </b></p>
                <p>
                    But designers do dream of joining teams where they feel valued, inspired, and can create meaningful
                    impact. I emphasized these aspects during recruitment conversations.
                </p>
                <p>The result? We built a powerhouse team of seven designers‚Äîeach bringing unique skills but sharing a
                    strong product sensibility.</p>

                <h3>Expanding Design's Influence</h3>

                <p>Exceptional leaders don‚Äôt just contribute; they magnify their teams' capabilities. As our business
                    gained momentum and approached product-market fit, I concentrated on building infrastructure for
                    sustainable growth.</p>

                <h4>The Transformation Catalyst: Our Design System</h4>
                <p>
                    In a rapid experimentation environment, it is hard to match speed without having proper systems in
                    place.
                    During my initial audit of the entire product, I found almost 20+ grey shades, numerous border
                    radius types, inconsistent typography, countless button styles, and more. But identifying these
                    issues wasn't enough‚Äîit was a hard sell.

                </p>
                <p>
                    When a product is pivoting, the business cares primarily about critical success factors. Pitching a
                    design system for roadmap consideration would likely get dropped because of other pressing issues.
                    <span class="highlighter"> People wanted to understand the business impact.</span>
                </p>
                <p>
                    To strengthen my case, I partnered with other departments and uncovered compelling business impacts:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>üì∞ The marketing team used screenshots from different products to sell features. Customers
                        frequently questioned these visuals, leading to trust issues.</li>
                    <li>üí® The sales team struggled to sell a dated-looking product in a competitive market.</li>
                    <li>ü§¶Ô∏è It was harder to attract top talent, as they were reluctant to work on outdated systems.
                    </li>
                    <li>üõ†Ô∏è Development efforts were wasted on redundant frontend components.</li>
                    <li>ü§¶Ô∏è Top design talent showed little interest in working with outdated aesthetics that wouldn't
                        enhance their portfolios.</li>
                </ul>

                <p>These findings created unanimous agreement that change was essential.</p>

                <h3>Crafting a Unified Vision</h3>

                <p>The new system empowered our design team to tackle complex problems without getting bogged down in
                    <span class="highlighter">consistency issues</span>. </p>

                <p>A vision without research is merely a guess. I studied all customer call recordings from the product
                    team to understand the US market and customer needs, then mapped various user journeys. We chose to
                    address high-value features within core workflows while simultaneously implementing our new design
                    language. Both tracks were crucial, and a waterfall approach would have failed.</p>
                <p>I made the deliberate decision to align our visual direction with our marketing website, creating a
                    unified experience for customers. This time, the marketing design team operated independently.</p>

                <h4>Reimagining Existing Functionality</h4>
                <p>Our product offered valuable features, integrations, and data, but users struggled to discover this
                    value. I wanted to demonstrate that by focusing on user needs, we could unlock new value from our
                    existing technology.</p>
                <p>Starting with our mobile app's InstaFyle feature, we simply repositioned a button‚Äîand watched
                    adoption soar from 40% to 82%. This exemplified how small changes can deliver massive impact.
                    Additionally, our refreshed mobile design language gave the marketing team better promotion
                    materials. Another impactful adjustment was optimizing our expense report PDF format, helping
                    customers print fewer pages and reduce their carbon footprint.</p>

                <h4>Refining Navigation and Information Architecture</h4>
                <p>Since engineers had driven much of the design, many flows, navigation patterns, and information
                    architecture weren't fully optimized.</p>
                <p>We needed to consolidate several workflows and restructure our information architecture to align with
                    users' mental models, making our product more intuitive. We eliminated modules built specifically
                    for the Indian market that no longer served our US customers.</p>
                <p>By this point, we had refreshed nearly 70% of the product with our new design language while
                    enhancing existing functionality, addressing usability issues, improving information architecture,
                    and optimizing flows‚Äîall while meeting our key performance indicators. Our strategy remained focused
                    on our core product principle: don't make users spend a single unnecessary second creating an
                    expense.</p>

                <h4>Rethinking Core Experiences</h4>
                <p>Platform elements like integrations required substantial overhauls and deeper research. Product and
                    design teams collaborated to solve these challenges and deliver transformative user experiences.</p>

                <h4>Driving Innovation</h4>
                <p>A groundbreaking partnership with Visa and Mastercard revolutionized how users submit expenses to
                    Fyle, challenging industry conventions around company-issued cards. This innovation shook the
                    expense management world, earning Fyle recognition in Forbes.</p>
                <p>Our design team partnered with Visa to understand legal requirements and create compliant solutions.
                    Remarkably, Visa approved our design on the first submission.</p>
                <p>With AI's growing influence, our team began exploring Copilot capabilities alongside product
                    development.</p>

                <h3>Building Momentum Through Transparency</h3>
                <p>I believe deeply in transparency, collaboration, and consistent communication. Rather than waiting
                    until our vision was "complete," I chose to be as open and iterative as possible throughout its
                    development.</p>
                <p>In every company town hall, we showcased our latest visual refreshes alongside usability improvements
                    and core issue fixes, steadily building excitement throughout the organization.</p>
                <p>This approach made vision-creation truly collaborative. Anyone in the company could contribute
                    insights, challenge assumptions, or connect us with customers for feedback.</p>

                <h3>Measuring Our Impact üìà</h3>
                <p>By building a strong design team and crafting a clear product vision and strategy, I helped drive
                    Fyle's business growth.</p>
                <p>Today, our product serves more than 1,000+ businesses and impacts over 800,000+ users with an
                    impressive NPS score of 62.</p>

                <ul>
                    <li><strong>2,000+</strong> Businesses onboarded</li>
                    <li><strong>62 NPS</strong> World-class rating for B2B</li>
                    <li><strong>0%</strong> Design team attrition over 2.5 years</li>
                    <li><strong>2 ‚Üí 7</strong> Design team growth</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Looking Back on the Journey</h3>
                <p>It has truly been a whirlwind, and I'm humbled by the journey I've shared with my design and
                    leadership teams. The path hasn't always been easy, and while we continue building toward our
                    vision, I remain deeply grateful for the incredible people who made it all possible.</p>
