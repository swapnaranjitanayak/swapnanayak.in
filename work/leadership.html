                    Leading a 5 year design vision at Fyle

                <p class="block-quote">Fyle is an expense management platform that streamlines the entire process from
                    submitting receipts to reimbursement. It helps businesses efficiently handle receipt collection,
                    approval workflows, compliance verification, and accounting integration.</p>



                <p>I joined Fyle as a senior designer during its early stages when the company was focused on
                    the Indian travel market. Fyle was forced to pivot to the US market during COVID, and unexpectedly
                    found iteself flooded with demo requests. There I was, still finding my footing in the product's new
                    positioning, yet suddenly thrust into <span class="highlighter"> navigating a series of rapid shifts.</span> üôÇ

                </p>
                <p>
                    I stepped up to <span class="highlighter">lead the team and the design strategy</span>. Over next four years, my work
                    directly contributed to Fyle's growth from <span class="highlighter">$0 to $8M+ in revenue.</span>

                </p>
                <h5>A brief</h5>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Primary Role:</strong> Senior Product Designer ‚Üí Associate Director</li>
                    <li><strong>Time Frame:</strong> 2019 - 2025</li>
                    <li><strong>Company Size:</strong> ~30 ‚Üí 150+</li>
                    <li><strong>Business Model:</strong> B2B2C, SaaS</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Walking through the flames üî•</h3>

                <p>When I stepped up to lead the team, the product and design decisions were predominantly <span class="highlighter">driven
                        by engineers</span>. They even led design critiques (yes, really! :P) and offered numerous subjective
                    comments. <span class="highlighter">Designers had lost their voice</span>. There was no formal
                    design team structure, and designers couldn't collaborate with peers to gain different perspectives.
                </p>

                <p>I needed to <span class="highlighter">transform this culture, build a strong team, and drive strategic vision. </span>
                    Hence, I prepared a foundational roadmap focused on three key pillars:</p>

                <ul>
                    <li><strong> ‚ú® Building the team</strong>: How I motivated my team</li>
                    <li><strong> üöÄ Maximizing design influence</strong>: How I removed obstacles and amplified my team's
                        impact</li>
                    <li><strong> üéØ Envisioning product excellence</strong>: How I developed and executed a compelling
                        product vision</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>‚ú® Building the team</h3>

                <p>It was a fascinating personal pivot when I woke up one day to find my relationships with colleagues had suddenly transformed. Though initially overwhelming, 
                    <span class="highlighter">I quickly
                        adapted and focused on building what was necessary.</span>
                </p>

                <h4>Drawing in exceptional talent</h4>
                <p>
                        To be honest, top designers <span class="highlighter">rarely dream of working</span> for an unfamiliar B2B SaaS company where
                        they'll <span class="highlighter">spend days designing data tables</span>. The challenge was even greater when our product
                        appeared dated.
                    </p>
                <p>
                    But people do dream of joining teams where they feel valued, inspired, and can create meaningful
                    impact.  I emphasized these aspects during recruitment conversations.
                </p>
                <p> We built a powerhouse team of seven designers‚Äîeach bringing unique skills but sharing a
                    strong product sensibility.</p>

                <img src="../img/designer.png" alt="" class="img-fluid">

                <h4>Establishing meaningful team rituals</h4>

                <p>As the product grew, I established several rituals to enhance collaboration <span class="highlighter">in our remote setting and
                    strengthen team bonds.</span></p>

                <ul>
                    <li>ü§ù <strong>Weekly Catchups</strong>: These synchronization meetings gave the team opportunities to share ongoing initiatives and receive feedback.</li>
                    <li>üñåÔ∏è <strong>Design Review Process</strong>: All individual contributions went through a design
                        owner's review cycle before meeting the product team.</li>
                    <li>üé≠ <strong>Friday Showcases</strong>: Fridays featured a mix of activities‚Äîcasual hangouts, game
                        sessions, or creative product explorations.</li>
                    <li>üéì <strong>Thoughtful Onboarding</strong>: I designed a buddy system for new members to ensure
                        they never felt lost.</li>
                </ul>

                <p>These rituals helped us maintain strong camaraderie and collaboration even as our team expanded.</p>
                <p>For 2.5 years, the design team maintained <span class="highlighter">a zero attrition
                    rate.</span></p>
                <h4>Nurturing early-career designers</h4>

                <p>Passionate about developing emerging talent, I initiated conversations with management about hiring interns and freshers.
                </p>

                <p>Over the years, <strong>we welcomed three interns, with two transitioning to full-time
                        positions.</strong> Those early birds who joined as freshers are now thriving <span class="highlighter">as mid level senior and lead designers.</span></p>

        
              
                <h3>üöÄ Maximizing design influence</h3>

                <p>As our business
                    gained momentum and approached product-market fit, I concentrated on building infrastructure for
                    sustainable growth of the team.</p>

                <h4>Bringing consistency and speed through Design System</h4>
                <p>
                    In a rapid experimentation environment, it is hard to match the speed without having proper systems in
                    place.
                    
                    During my initial audit of the entire product, I found several inconsistent patterns ranging from colors, numerous border
                    radius types to inconsistent typography, countless button styles, and more. <span class="highlighter">But identifying these
                        issues wasn't enough‚Äîit was a hard sell.</span>

                </p>
                <p>
                    When a product is pivoting, the business cares primarily about critical success factors. Pitching a
                    design system for roadmap consideration would likely get dropped because of other pressing issues.
                    <span class="highlighter"> I needed to explain the business impact.</span>
                </p>
                <p>
                    To strengthen my case, I deeped dived and found the following issues:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>üì∞ The marketing team used different graphics for feature explanations to sell features. Customers
                        <span class="highlighter">frequently questioned these visuals</span>, leading to trust issues.</li>
                    <li>üí® The sales team struggled to sell <span class="highlighter">a dated-looking product</span> in a competitive market.</li>
                    <li>ü§¶Ô∏è It <span class="highlighter">was harder to attract top talent</span>, as they were reluctant to work on outdated systems.
                    </li>
                    <li>üõ†Ô∏è Development efforts were wasted on redundant frontend components.</li>
               
                </ul>

                <p>These findings created unanimous agreement that change was essential.

                    The new system empowered the design team to tackle complex problems without getting bogged down in
                    <span class="highlighter">consistency issues</span>. 
               
                </p>
 
                <h3>üéØ Crafting a unified vision</h3>

                <p> I went through all <span class="highlighter">customer call recordings</span> from the product
                    team to understand the US market and customer needs, then <span class="highlighter">mapped various user journeys</span>. We chose to
                    address <span class="highlighter">high-value features</span> within core workflows while simultaneously implementing our new design
                    language. Both tracks were crucial, and a waterfall approach would have failed.</p>
                <p>I made the deliberate decision to align <span class="highlighter">product's visual direction with product's marketing website</span>, creating a
                    unified experience for customers. </p>
                
                    
                        <img src="../img/marketing-product.png" alt="" class="img-fluid">
                    </p>

                <h4>Reimagining existing functionality</h4>
                <p>Our product offered valuable features, but users struggled to discover this
                    value. I wanted to demonstrate that by <span class="highlighter">focusing on user needs</span>, we could unlock new value from our
                    existing technology.</p>
                <p>Starting with spender's mobile app, we repositioned InstaFyle feature access for capturing expense receipt and watched
                    adoption soar <span class="highlighter">from 40% to 82%</span>. This exemplified how small changes can deliver massive impact.
                    Additionally, our refreshed mobile design language gave the marketing team better promotion
                    materials. </p>

                    <p>
                        <img src="../img/mobile-app.webp" alt="" class="img-fluid">
                    </p>

                <h4>Refining navigation, flows, IA and fixing 100+ usability issues</h4>
                <p>Since engineers had driven much of the design, many flows, navigation patterns, and information
                    architecture weren't fully optimized.</p>
                <p>We needed to consolidate <span class="highlighter">several workflows and restructure our information architecture </span>to align with
                    users' mental models, making our product more intuitive. We eliminated modules built specifically
                    for the Indian market that no longer served our US customers.</p>
                <p>By this point, we had refreshed nearly 70% of the product with our new design language while
                    enhancing existing functionality, addressing usability issues, improving information architecture,
                    and optimizing flows‚Äîall while meeting our key performance indicators. </p>
                    <p>
                        Our <span class="highlighter">strategy</span> remained focused
                    on our core product principle: don't make users spend a single unnecessary second creating an
                    expense.
                    </p>
                    <p>These initiatives helped us increasing our <span class="highlighter">NPS from 35 to 60+ within 6 months.</span></p>

                <h4>Rethinking core experiences</h4>
                <p>Platforms like integrations required substantial overhauls and deeper research. Product and
                    design teams collaborated to solve these challenges and deliver transformative user experiences.</p>


                <h4>Driving innovation</h4>
                <p>A groundbreaking partnership with <span class="highlighter">Visa and Mastercard revolutionized</span> how users submit expenses to
                    Fyle, challenging industry conventions around company-issued cards. This innovation shook the
                    expense management world, earning Fyle recognition in Forbes.</p>
                <p>The design team partnered with Visa to understand legal requirements and create compliant solutions.
                    <span class="highlighter">Remarkably, Visa approved the design on the first submission.</span></p>
                <p><span class="highlighter">With AI's growing influence, the team began exploring Copilot capabilities alongside product
                    development beforeI I left Fyle</span>.</p>
                <h4>Building momentum through transparency</h4>
                <p>In every <span class="highlighter">company town hall</span> & dedicated slack channel, we showcased our latest visual refreshes alongside usability improvements
                    and core issue fixes, steadily building excitement throughout the organization.</p>
                <p>This approach made vision-creation truly collaborative. Anyone in the company could contribute
                    insights, challenge assumptions, or connect us with customers for feedback.</p>

                <h3>üìà Measuring impact </h3>
                <p>By building a strong design team and crafting a clear product vision and strategy, I helped drive
                    Fyle's business growth.</p>
               
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>0 -> $8M+</strong> Businesses growth</li>
                    <li><strong>0%</strong> Design team attrition over 2.5 years</li>
                    <li><strong>2 ‚Üí 7</strong> Design team growth</li>
                </ul>

                <p>In its embedded offerings, more than <span class="highlighter">1,000+ businesses</span> are already onboarded impacting over <span class="highlighter">800,000+ users</span> with just 1 client before I left.
                </p>


                <h3>Looking back</h3>
                <p>I'm humbled by the journey I've shared with the design and
                    leadership teams. The path hasn't always been easy, and while we continue building toward our
                    vision, I remain deeply grateful for the incredible people who made it all possible.</p>
